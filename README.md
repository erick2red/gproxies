## GProxies

It's a tool for fast switching between several proxy configurations. It's been developed
mainly for [GNOME][1] desktop, but I hope will work for some other use cases.


### Features

* Keeps a list of proxy settings
* Provides an intuitive way of setting the active proxy
* Provides a plugins system to allow changing proxy settings on other
  applications besides GNOME

### Plugins

Plugins are meant for updating any other configuration you want with
the activated proxy details. In [gproxies-plugins][2] repository I'd place
some plugins. [Plugins](PLUGINS.md) contains some details about how to make a
plugin
